According to my [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/) mentor Walter G. in a recent [article](https://www.thatsoftwaredude.com/content/11407/why-every-developer-needs-a-tech-blog-in-2021) on his website [thatsoftwaredude](https://www.thatsoftwaredude.com), "Whether you are just getting started with a programming language and a tech stack, or if you have 10 years of experience already and building complex scalable apps, you need to have a blog."  So, I decided to start a blog.

First, I had to choose a blogging platform.  I thought coding a blog from scratch like Walter would be too hard, but using a WYSIWYG web editor like Blogger would be too easy.  So I eventually decided that [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) would be "just right," for the following reasons:

* Free, integrated hosting for Jekyll sites on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with custom domain name
* I can write posts in Markdown on a local text editor and serve my site locally (with live refresh!) before pushing to GitHub to publish
* All the code is on my machine, where I can tinker with it
* I'm currently focusing on HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, so I don't really need anything else

Despite Jekyll's claim, "Get up and running in seconds," getting this up and running was a laborious process.  But that's material for another post.
