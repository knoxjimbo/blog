Whelp, I quit Thinkful's coding bootcamp.  I realized I have no passion for programming, and it was just another "shadow career."  I learned about "shadow careers" in a book I've been reading, *Turning Pro*, by Steven Pressfield.

> Sometimes, when we're terrified of embracing our true calling, we'll pursue a shadow calling instead.  That shadow career is a metaphor for our real career.  Its shape is similar, its contours feel tantalizingly the same.  But a shadow career entails no real risk.  If we fail at a shadow career, the consequences are meaningless to us.

Are you living the drugs-and-booze half of the musician's life, without actually writing the music?  Are you working in a support capacity for an innovator because you're afraid to risk becoming an innovator yourself?

I don't want to program machines; I want to program people.  I am scared of failing because I've already failed, twice, at great fiscal and emotional cost.  But I'm also finally ready to turn pro.
